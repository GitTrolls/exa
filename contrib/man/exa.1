.PP
exa \- a modern replacement for ls
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
exa [\f[I]options\f[]] [\f[I]files\f[]]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]exa\f[] is a modern replacement for \f[C]ls\f[].
It uses colours for information by default, helping you distinguish
between many types of files, such as whether you are the owner, or in
the owning group.
It also has extra features not present in the original \f[C]ls\f[], such
as viewing the Git status for a directory, or recursing into directories
with a tree view.
